# Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks
Repository to code the exercises or examples shown in the book.

If you want to test the code that I'm putting here:
 For Java
 
 Use the Java Compiler, e.g:
   - javac SourceCode.java
   - java SourceCode
  

In the future I'll try to use a tool to compile all the project, anyway you will need to execute the class that you will want to study. I don't have plans to make a tool for this purpose.

### Disclaimer:

 All the code in this repository is exactly the same, similar or based on the book "Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks" by Paul Butcher. I don't own this code and I'm just using this repository for academic purposes and to keep track of my progress in the book
